There will be times when you cannot see how you can succeed in what you are doing. No amount of planing or overthinking can lead you out of that tricky situation. When all hope seems lost, the only way forward is to execute and find out. I'm not saying you shouldn't plan or think, I'm saying that you should go on and execute the best way you know how, and see what happens.  

When you do what needs to be done, there will be three possible outcomes. You succeed, you fail, or you learn. 

If you succeed, that means you already have what it takes. You just need to execute properly each time. Of course there will still be room for growth, but for the current endeavor you have, you've grown enough to handle it.

If you fail, that means you haven't gotten anything fruitful from that endeavor, and it has crushed your spirit, and you gave up on it. People think failure is not reaching your goal, but I think failure is giving up before you have given it your all. Know that you are allowed to fail, and you are allowed to learn from it.

If you learn, that means you saw what you are lacking, and you are willing to work on it in order to succeed in a subsequent attempt. You didn't wallow in failure and you recognize that not accomplishing your goal means there are some aspects you need to improve on.Â You won't always learn from success, but you are guaranteed to learn from failure if know how to look back and analyze the mistakes you've made. 
  
Sometimes I lose hope because I'm are afraid of the idea of failure. Thinking about failure exaggerates it in my mind, and I become to afraid to move. It is hard to move forward when all you see is fear. But I've realize that failure is not the only outcome. I could also succeed, and learn from what happened. Now, I cling to that idea that no matter the outcome, I can still move forward in hope that things will go well.
