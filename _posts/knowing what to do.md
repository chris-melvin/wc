title: 'Knowing what to do'
excerpt: Most people think they know how a car works. They turn the steering wheel left to go left, and turn it right to go right. They step on the gas to move forward and step on the brakes to slow down and eventually stop. It's simple. Most people know how to do it, but when it breaks down. A lot of people don't know what to do.

Most people think they know how a car works. They turn the steering wheel left to go left, and turn it right to go right. They step on the gas to move forward and step on the brakes to slow down and eventually stop. It's simple. Most people know how to do it, but when it breaks down. A lot of people don't know what to do.

This is how I used to view my life. When life is going smoothly, I thought I know what to do. I encounter small bumps here and there but nothing major. Life was easy and everything was great. I thought that was all to it until my life broke down. My understanding of life fell apart. It's not just about steering left and right, stepping on the gas, and hitting the brakes. I saw the full complexity of life. What I thought I know about life is just a small fraction of what I need to know. Just because all those years life has been running smoothly doesn't mean that is all life has to offer. 

There are a lot of things I haven't experienced yet. There is a lot to learn. Even though my life has broken down, it can still be fixed. Even though I don't know how to fix my life, there is someone who can. His name is Jesus. He knows what to do, and I'm going to trust Him to fix my life and take the wheel.
