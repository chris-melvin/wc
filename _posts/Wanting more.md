It is human nature to want something more. When we eat something delicious like steak or lobster, more often than not, we would take the bigger portions because we want to enjoy a lot of it. We want savor the taste of the food while dipped in our favorite sauce. The more I understand about this desire of humans to want more, I more I become curious about it. 

Wanting more is not bad per se, desire should have its proper object. If the desire is just fueled by selfish reasons, then nothing good will come out of it. When you desire for more of something then you somehow you acquire it, the excitement will only last for a moment. You will start to want other things. Then the pattern continues. You will continue to seek more and more things. The way to combat this is by being grateful. If you are grateful for what you receive, you won't focus on wanting more but for appreciating what you have. 

Gratitude is our way of satiating our infinite desires. Gratitude itself doesn't satisfy but it allows us to be satisfied with what we have. Taking time to pause everyday will help you overcome the fear of missing out. Sometimes we get anxious because we want to have something or to become part of something but we don't have the means to do so. Gratitude will realign you to what matters most and will help you overcome all of those worries.
