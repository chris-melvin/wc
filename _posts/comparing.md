Don't stop comparing

Know the place where you should be, know the place where you are now, and know the place where you were and compare yourself to that. When people say stop comparing yourself to others, you reacted in a way that you totally stopped comparing yourself with anything. Without comparison, you won't know where you are. You won't have direction. 

You should compare yourself from where you are now to where you want to go. You should go to the direction to which you want to go. You cannot just aimlessly travel and expect to end up where you want to be. You need to direct yourself to go there. Of course there will be a lot of obstacles, but that means you are going the right way. When playing video games, in order to know where to go, you need to follow where the enemies are. If you just go randomly to place, you might discover loot, but that doesn't mean you are moving forward. You still need to face the enemies in order to finish that stage of the game. 

You need to know where you are in order to orient yourself properly in the world. To do that, you need to compare yourself with where you've been, where you are, and where you want to go.
