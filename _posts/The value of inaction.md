Sometimes, not doing anything is the best course of action. There are some actions that could cause you more when you do it than when you didn't do it. The stock market, for example, if you invest then it went down, you will lose money, but if you didn't invest, then you won't lose any money.

Determining when you should take action is key in making decisions. Just like the stock market, in life, you need to asses the right time to take action. When inaction is the best play, learn to be still. When emotions are high, you should decide slow, or better yet, don't think about anything risky. More often than not, when emotions are high, you will make the wrong decision. 

Inaction doesn't necessarily mean you are being lazy, it just means you are waiting for when you ready to take action. It is wise to do nothing when there is nothing to do. Doing something could make the situation worse. 

When emotions are high, it is better to take a rest than to make a risky decision. Sleeping could solve a lot of problems. It could help you make better decisions afterward.

Don't be hasty. Pause, think, and then decide.
