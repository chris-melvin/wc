I just wrote about having no day off but right now I'm not in the mood to do anything. I don't have any good ideas to write about so I'm writing about what I feel. Today feels like an off day. I did nothing productive and I don't have the drive to do anything productive. I'm just looking for things to enjoy. 

Even though I don't have the motivation to do anything, I still write because I don't need motivation to write. I already built the habit of writing. I'm going to write even though I don't feel like it. There are forces other than motivation that will push us to do something. 

I think in our "Off days", it is crucial to keep on doing because this is when momentum is gained or lost. If we keep on, then we continue to gain momentum, if we stop, then it will be harder to continue on the next day. 

Off days come once in a while. Don't fear the time when you are unproductive. Just keep on going. Creative ideas come when you create more.
