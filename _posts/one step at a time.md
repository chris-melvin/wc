If you want to change your life, you don't need to go through something drastic in order for it to happen. What you need to do is to change what you do. You need to build systems for growth. If you remain the same person, but change your circumstances, e.g. you become exponentially wealthier, then you will still go back to where you used to be. You are still the same person with a different circumstance. Eventually, you will come back to mediocrity or where you used to be. Not financially, but quality of life. 

If you drink a lot of alcohol, play a lot of games, and immerse yourself in entertainment before, if you haven't change, and your circumstance change you will experience all of what you do, but in a greater scale. You will be able to consume alcohol you cound't afford before. You will be able to play a lot of games and spend money for in-game items. You will be able to experience world class entertainment and  all of it will be at your disposal. 

You have the same life, just a bigger scale. In terms of self-improvement, you are not better. In order to handle a circumstantial change in your life, you need to change something in yourself. You need to be adaptable. Being adaptable means what ever environment you are in, you can function the most optimal way you know how. 

Change takes time, and it takes effort. Whatever we do, we must subject ourselves to change, if not, then we will stay where we are and we will decline in our growth.
