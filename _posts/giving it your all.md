title: 'Giving it your all'
excerpt: Sometimes we just want to do the bare minimum because we just want to move on. We don't want to give our full effort because we think the task we need to do is not worthy of our time and effort. We just do it because we need to. This is what I do when I don't enjoy the subject in school.

Sometimes we just want to do the bare minimum because we just want to move on. We don't want to give our full effort because we think the task we need to do is not worthy of our time and effort. We just do it because we need to. This is what I do when I don't enjoy the subject in school. I don't study to learn, I just study to pass. I think it is a waste of time to give my full attention but I just realized that its a much more waste if I don't.

Not giving your full effort in something is much more of a waste because time is still passing and you are just in idle mode. The time will still pass, you might as well use it wisely. Pay attention to whatever you are doing, and give all your effort. If you don't want to give your attention to something you need to do, what will you give it to? Eventually, all those things will come back knocking because they need to be done. Maybe not immediately, but it will. The time you spend slacking around instead of working on what you need to do will never comeback. You could have spent the whole day working, instead you just watched youtube videos you won't even remember. You just played games that you don't even enjoy. 

When you give your all to doing one thing, good results will surely follow. You don't control the outcome but you control what you do. Sometimes we are afraid to give it our all because you if we fail, we don't have an excuse. But if we procrastinate until the end, we have this fantasy that we could have done better if we started on time. 

The results doesn't matter as long as you are giving it your all. If you have a bad result now, then see what you can improve on. Learn from it, become better. Don't let one failure keep you from doing your best. Eventually, the fruit of your work will come. All those bad results from the past are just stepping stones for you to have the best outcome.
