Your growth is not one and done. You don't just practice once then you are good at it. Let's say you are practicing your Spanish. Just because you had a really wonderful time talking with someone in Spanish doesn't mean you are good enough to not practice again. You need to go on with your practice.

You are always a student, no matter how long you have been teaching. You will still learn more. Even though you have progressed really far, you can still progress further. You can still do things better. Starting something and not finishing it is a sign you are not committed to see the end of what you do. You just want to try it out. 

I think it is okay, because you want to know the experience of learning something, but if you end up trying to learn a lot of things and not seeing through until the end of one thing, then you are just wasting your time. You should commit to something and see what happens. Even though there is no immediate progress or no product is immediately produced, just keep on. You won't know what happen in the end until you are there. 

Your decisions should not be based on your motivations but based on you looking at where you want to be and continuing towards it no matter how difficult it is to traverse the path. You need to keep on, because you are not your progress. The distance you have traveled does not define who you are. It is hard and you will be distracted but go on one step at a time. It will be difficult and you will experience suffering, in the physical and mental aspects but it will be worth it. You either go through the fire now and be victorious in the end or just enjoy life now, not caring about anything then suffer in the future. 

Delay gratification because if you do, you won't be addicted to instant rewards. You will appreciate the value of hard work and really doing your due diligence in everything you do. A little by little, you can become better. 

Even though you don't see any progress, in the bigger picture, what you do today adds up to what tomorrow will be.
