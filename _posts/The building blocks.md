I like the concept of components in web development. Essentially, components are the building blocks of your website. Each feature could be a component. The Navigation bar could be a component, the home page could be a component, the blog snippet could be a component. It makes it easy to reuse those components as building blocks to create the whole website. 

When applying the concept of components or building blocks in our lives, I asked myself a question. What are the components or building blocks that I have in my life. What are the different facets of life that when put together is who I am as a whole. I want to understand that so I could prioritize the things I need to do at the moment. I've written down the blocks as Spiritual, Health, Wealth, Mind, and Social. These building blocks has specific things I do. Of course, it is hard to balance all of those things but one things has to become a priority in order to me to excel in everything else. 

One block has to become the one everything else stands on. If I work on that block, then everything else will follow. For some people, they focus on building their wealth, for some, their health, but for me, I think I will focus on the spiritual aspect of my life. This should be the block I stand on. 

If I prioritize the spirtual block, then everything else could stand on it. If try to divide it evenly, then the blocks would have no strong foundation, and it will become wobbly. 

Each building block is important but we have to understand that we need that block we can stand on. You chose which block would be the best to have a foundation on.
