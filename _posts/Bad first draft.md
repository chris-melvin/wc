Often times, we want to be perfect, but perfection only exist in Jesus. When you start to work, you will make mistakes. There is a story about a class. A pottery making class. The class was divided into two groups, the first group was tasked to make the most beautiful vase, while the other group was tasked to make as many vases as they can. 

The first group, knowing that they should produce a high quality vase, started conceptualizing and planning on what they need to do. The second group just started making vases because they are tasked to make as many as they can. 

When the final day came, the group who was tasked to create a single beautiful vase ended up making a good looking vase, but the group tasked with making as much as they can ended up creating a much better looking vase because the more they created the more they become better at what they do compared to the group who just planned and only made one.

That is why you should start making now. Allow yourself to make something that is not "perfect". A book idea will never be written unless you are willing to write a bad first draft. Your imperfections are part of your story. It is uniquely your own. Don't be ashamed of it. 

**Done is better than perfect.**
