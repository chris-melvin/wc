If you want to improve the quality of your life, improve the quality of your sleep. Sleep is one-third of your life. If the quality of your sleep is low, then you will struggle in your waking hours. I have learned this the hard way. Often times, I struggle to go to sleep. When I lie down on bed, I usually watch some youtube video to help me sleep but I just learned that staring at a screen during the night will worsen my sleep. 

The more I watch random youtube videos during the night, the later I get to sleep. Sometimes I just find myself watching random videos at 2am because I was struggling to sleep at 12. My sleeping time got pushed so bad that I often wake up on the afternoon. 

When I realized I need to make a change, I tried waking up early. I had to make drastic changes to my sleep cycle. I tried staying up as long as I can until I pushed my sleep to normal. I was sleeping at 9pm and waking up at 5 or 6 am for a month. I noticed that I was more productive and my life was better. i can enjoy afternoons while reading a book. The best change I noticed was my eating habits was better. I was able to eat three times a day compared to eating 1 - 2 times when my sleep cycle was a mess. 

There are a lot of benefits when you increase the quality of your sleep but I can't list them all here. Even though it is hard to do at first, but if you try to build a healthy sleep schedule then your life will drastically be better.
