You can't chose other peoples sacrifices for them. Most of the time, when people make sacrifices, they do it on their own volition. They are not force by other people to do it. I have seen a lot of movies where one of the main characters have sacrificed themselves in order to save the world. They were not forced to make those sacrifices, they just did them. 

When we try to force other people to make sacrifices because it is for the greater good, then the sacrifice is not really authentic. It is just a command to lay a life of another pawn. But when they chose to do it on their own, then it  becomes more authentic and real. The value of the sacrifice becomes better and I think it will bring more positive effect.

When making sacrifices in our own lives, like not drinking coffee or sleeping early and missing out on late night talks, you can't push other people to do it with you. You just have to show them the effects. You can tell them you are doing it, and maybe even ask them to do it with you, but you cannot force them. The benefits might be good, but if they don't understand why you are doing it, or they are not willing to commit to that, they you are just talking to the wind. They won't hear you properly because you don't have the same foundations of why you are doing it. They don't have the same convictions as you. What you need to do is to share to them your convictions, if they share it, then share to them your plan. If they don't share your convictions, then just move on. Most of the time, we can't convince someone who is not open t  o new ideas, or certain ideas. 

Sacrifices in your own life is necessary but I think the term shouldn't be sacrifice but surrender. When you surrender something, you surrender to an authority. For most people, those authority is God. When you surrender something, sometimes, it is hard to let go at first, but eventually, it will be easier. 

We just have to let go, little by little.
