You are not willing to go beyond the obstacle because you are afraid of what's next. You are afraid that there is another obstacle, so the solution is that you don't go beyond the obstacle in front of you in order to not face another obstacle. It's like a big brain play when you look at it at first, but the problem with that is you are stuck.

You will be stuck where you are if you are not willing to solve the problems in front of you. Maybe you are not willing because you have no vision of the future. You are not going beyond because nothing is making sense for you. You have nothing to look forward to. I've experienced this feeling before. I'm not willing to go beyond because I  thought that everything that I experienced everything there is in life. I know it sounds crazy but my perspective was really small. I can only see a few things life has to offer. 

When I've realized that there is so much more to life, then I started to go again. I'm willing to go beyond the obstacles in front of me so I could see the world better. Yes, it will be hard and problems will come along the way but I know it is worth it because this life is beautiful. There is so much things to enjoy.

Be willing to go beyond where you are now because you are not going to stay there forever.
