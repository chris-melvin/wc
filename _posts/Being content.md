Our lives are filled with so many opportunities. Often times, we miss some of those opportunities when we want more even though we were given a good thing. We won't realize we are making a mistake at the moment but after a while, we will realize how much we have missed by not taking the opportunity presented to us. 

I think there are multiple reasons why we are not contented with what we have. The first one I think is because we want something better. It is hard to grab is in front of us because often times it is a commitment. Once we get it, we can't get anything else. So we wait for something better. After a while, that better won't come and we will realize that we should have taken what was given to us rather than waiting.

The second reason I think we are not contented is because we are not grateful for the opporunities that come. We think of ourselves to highly and we think we deserve those opportunities. Being grateful, as I have said before is the best way to become content. Being grateful for what you have allows you to see and appreciate the things around you. Rather than wanting more, you will be filled because you will realize that what you have is enough. 

This world has so much to offer, but nothing can satisfy our desires. If we depend on material things alone, we won't be contented. Only in Jesus we will realize what true contentment means.
