In life, we are dealt with different cards. Some people are dealt with good hands, some people not so good. It is worth noting that even though people are dealt the same hands, you should still play. Play the hands you are dealt. Don't try to look at other people and say it is not fair because what you have been given is enough for you. You should focus on what you have and make the best out of it. If you spend all of your time complaining about how unfair life is, you won't be able to live it out. 

Your life, or what you do with your life depends on your current circumstances and what you decide to do in those circumstances. The key is you need to focus on your current circumstances. You shouldn't judge your success based on other people. If you succeed, even though it is not as grand as other people's, that is still success. The cards you are dealt with, if played properly will not will as much as other people's cards but if you do win, no matter how little, still celebrate it. 

Each day is an opportunity to use the time we have to become better. You can spend time consuming entertainment, or you could be improving yourself. You could learn or master a new skill if you spend time on it. Even a mere 15 minutes a day could make you better than 99% of all the people on a certain skill. Most people don't spend the time bettering themselves. You being aware of what you have and doing your best to make use of what you have can propel you towards more and more success.

The cards we are dealt are uniquely ours. The job we have is to play it the best way we know how and hope for the best.
