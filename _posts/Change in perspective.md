Perspective is a profound word. I can talk about it all day but right now, I want to explore a little idea. Perspective, simply put is your point of view. When people say change in perspective, they mean change in the way you view things. You look at something from a different angle. The idea I want to explore is when you are seeing something different not because you are looking at something in a different way, but because you are moving forward. 

Imagine an obstacle far away, you look at it as something really small, and of course you don't think about it but it is far away into the future. The closer you get to it, the bigger it gets. Once you are in front of it, then it is as its biggest from your perspective. You didn't change your point of view, it just became closer to you. But once you have over came the obstacle, then it starts to get smaller because you are now getting farther and farther from it. 

One of my point is that when you are nearest to an obstacle is when it appears the largest. The other point is sometimes, it is not that our way of viewing things change when we are growing and moving forward, it is just that we see things differently because we are in another place.
