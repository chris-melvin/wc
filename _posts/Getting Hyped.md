It is easy to get caught in the hype especially in today's day and age. With the advent of social media, and other technologies, influencers can create a wave that ripples across many domains. Let's take NFTs for example, influencers who has a lot of following like Gary Vee brought this technology into the mainstream. His incessant desire to talk about NFTs made into the front page of the news. Getting caught in this hype could be good or bad depending on how you approach it. 

A lot of value will be created and lost during the hype because the people who knows what they are doing will make the right decisions, and the people who is just riding the hype will make decisions based on heightend emotions. It is necessary for everyone to inform themselves of what they are getting into. You can't just invest in something without deep knowledge about it. You need to understand the technology, and the risk involve in the investment. When the hype dies down, those assets that have value will retain its value and those assets that only have value because of the hype will lose it. 

It is okay to ride the wave, but ride is carefully. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Do the necessary research, and don't make decisions out of your emotions.
