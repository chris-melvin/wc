The International is the biggest e-sports event in the world. It is held every year, except during 2020 lockdown. The stories being unfolded, the great comebacks, team fights, and overall dota action will get people hooked. Of course, we will support the teams with players from our country, and I am no different. I supported T1 and EG because of the Filipino players but I also enjoy watching their games.

It is great to enjoy the ups and downs of the competition. When my team is winning, I celebrate it, and when my team is losing, I still hope they can make a comeback. So much expectations have been set for EG and T1. EG was one of the favorites coming into The International, and T1 was hoping to go far into the competition. 

Both teams had great group stages, but EG was on the lower bracket while T1 was in the upper bracket. EG won their first lower bracket game and proceeded to the next round, while T1 lost their match which sent them to the lower bracket. EG then faced VG in a best-of-three in which they won the first game but lost two games straight. VG then proceed to face T1 on the next round of the lower bracket. T1 won the first game. Again my team won the first game, but they lost 2 games back to back so VG took the series 2-1. 

It was a great competitive moment. I enjoyed watching my teams compete but sadly they were eliminated. As a fan I need to accept the defeat. I doesn't hurt as much because I'm not that invested but I'm still sad about it. I can still enjoy the remaining games, but not as much because I'm not rooting for anyone anymore. I will watch for the great plays and I also want to see how it unfolds. 

Accepting defeat means moving on and learning from what happened.
