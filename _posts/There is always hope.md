We can sometimes feel as if we are trapped where we are. When we try to escape, or try to become better there is a brief period when we are better, but after a while, we are back to our old habits again. This has happened a lot of times in my life. Whenever I feel like I want to be better, I stop playing video games, and start doing creative things such as writing, and programming. But after a while, lost momentum and I just go back to my old ways. 

I thought there was no hope. I thought I would never break the cycle of being in a rut, being productive for a while, then going back to my old bad habits. There are multiple reasons why I am in this cycle. I don't know everything but I am sure of one thing, it is not permanent. I'm not permanently stuck where I am. I could become better. It is not an easy process, but with the help of my friends, we can become better together. 

There is always hope. I know some people don't want hope because they don't want to be disappointed. I don't blame them, they have been through so much, and have experienced so much pain that hope scares them. It will take time, but I hope you can hope again.
