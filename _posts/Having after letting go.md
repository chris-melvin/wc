We all have our desires. We want to have something. I don't know what that is exactly for each individual, but there is something that people would cross oceans for. The desire to have that token is not in itself the ownership, but what comes with it. People don't want gold for the sake of having gold, but the prestige that comes with owning gold. I think every desire we have is rooted in our desire to be loved. We just added additional layers to it, and redirected our love to different things. 

We want to have something in order to feel love. But it has many layers. People don't usually realize this but often, they don't know their motivations in doing something. People do things to be accepted, acknowledged, and praised but the end goal is still love. People can do ridiculous things because they want to feel love. 

Until people have realized that being accepted, acknowledged, or praised is not the goal, they will continue to chase things that think will make they worth loving. 

Life is not about having the most money but having real connections. We are connected to other people through authenticity. If we are authentic, and people accept the real you, true connection is formed. That is why we are connected with God. God know the real us. There are no filters, and he knows our sins, yet He love us. Nothing can separate us from His love. 

We have to let go of the notion that we have to have something, or we have to become someone to be loved by God. God already loves you. You just need to live it out.
