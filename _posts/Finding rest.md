# Finding Rest
We have all experienced moments when we are tired. These are the moments when we just want to rest. We don't want to think of anything. We just want to clear out all the things that causes stress in our lives. When this happens, there are different places we run to. Our places of comfort are different, and those places of comfort have different effects to our well-being. 

## Running towards entertainment
When I get tired of all the responsibilities I have, the first thing I run to is my entertainment. I try to look for movies that will give me some peace of mind. Those movies that can motivate me to move forward. I also play games. There are games that gives me the sense of accomplishment. I play those games because more often than not, I don't  get that feeling when doing my school work. Running towards my entertainment is beneficial but it has its limitations. 

Up to a point, entertainment is useful but when it becomes something I drown myself in. It no longer serves its purpose of diverting my attention from the work I do. It became my main thing. Instead of reducing my stress, the games I play is causing my stress because I have been so engross in it. 

## Running towards friends
Talking to friends is one of the best place where you can find rest. They listen to you when you are in a vulnerable state and just want someone who will understand. They will help you in the times when you need to relax because they will relax with you. Having good friends is just a great thing because just by spending time together, you can make each others day better. 

There will be times when you can't run to your friends because they also have own moments of crisis. They also get tired. 

## Running towards Jesus
Jesus is the one place you can run to and He will give you peace. He is there to carry your burden for you. You can tell Him everything, and He will listen. He will be with you always. 

> 28 “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. 29 Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 30 For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”
> Matthew 11:28-30

Entertainment can help you rest from the things that cause you stress, but only to a certain point. You friends can help you rest but they won't always be there because they have their own things to attend to. Only in Jesus can you find true rest because He is always there and He will give you peace beyond what your entertainment and your friends can provide. Come to Jesus when you are tired because He is always there for you.
