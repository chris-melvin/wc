The feeling of emptiness is something most of us feel. When we are alone in our room, and we want to talk to someone, but we have no one to talk to. We look for something to fill that void in our heart. Anything we can put into it, but nothings seems to satisfy that longing. For most people, it will take a lifetime for them to realize what's missing, for some, they never really find it, and for most, they just try to fill that void with anything. They just drown themselves with material things.

What is that void in your heart? What is the one thing you need in order to be satiated from your longing. It was Pascal who said  “There is a God-shaped vacuum in the heart of each man which cannot be satisfied by any created thing but only by God the Creator, made known through Jesus Christ.” No created thing could ever satisfy the longing in our hearts. Once you have exhausted all your resources trying to find the thing that will satisfy, you will realize that only God can. 

Maybe the reason you feel empty is because you know what can satisfy you but you are not accepting it because it means you have to lay down a lot of things that you enjoy. Even though the things have cannot fill the emptiness that you feel, you are still not willing to let them go. You still think they may have some utility but they don't. They just weight you down. The emptiness you feel is not from not having anything, but from having the wrong things. We feel empty not because we are desolate, but because what we have, and what we have is meaningless. They are only there to fill the void temporarily

Maybe the solution to our emptiness is not looking for what could satisfy us, but letting go of the things we think could satisfy. If our hearts are full of things we don't need, then what we need won't have a place to be in.
