Most people think their ideal life is far in the future when they are financially stable. Having a lot of money means you have the ability to buy the things you want. It will allow you to live a life you want to live. Money gives people access to a lifestyle that most people can't even imagine. Money will enable us to do a lot of things. It will even allow us to live our ideal life but I think you can live your ideal life now. 

I don't mean that you will have all the money in the world to be able to afford the things you want. Living your ideal life means you are able to do what you want with what you have. Imagine a realistic good day. You wake up in the morning, excited for what's about to happen. You eat a good breakfast, you medidate, and then you have a morning session for work. After that, you eat lunch, take an afternoon break, then continue with your work. Then you'll have dinner, then you will spend a few hours doing your hobbies. After that, you get ready to go to bed, then you sleep. I'm not saying that everyone's good day is like this, but this is just to get the sense of it. 

Now, like most people it is hard to live your life in such a strict schedule. It is not fun because instead you deciding what you to do, your schedule decides for you. This is how I used to think. I wanted freedom in my day. I wanted to do what ever I want whenever. But I have realize that I'm the one who makes my schedule. The things I put on my calendar are the things I'm going to do. Making a schedule no longer feels like work. It is just a list of things I wanted to do. 

Write down your ideal day. Try to live it out by scheduling the things you need to do, and you want to do. It will greatly change your life.
