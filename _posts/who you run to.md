You are who you run to when your world seems to fall apart. There are different things people run to when they are stressed or overwhelmed. It could be computer games, gambling, movies, hanging it with friends, or going on a trip. What you run to becomes a big part of who you are. If you are stressed and you just wanted to drown all your pain with pleasure, then you will progressively be hooked to whatever it is that you do. If your only solution to pain is by drowning it, then you will have a hard time healing. 

Instead trying to drown your pain, the best thing you could do is to understand why you are hurting. There is someone who knows your pain and you can run to Him anytime. His name is Jesus. He understand what you are going through, if you run to Him, you will become like Him. 

In your most vulnerable moments, the things you do have a big effect on you. If you run to Jesus during times of hurt and pain, then you will be healed. You won't have a hard time trying to dig up the pain because the pain is just there. If you wait for a long time, then the pain you are experiencing will be buried within your heart and it will take a long time to be healed.
