Most of the time, we know how to handle and react to our emotions. When we feel sad, or happy, we just act accordingly. But when we feel strong emotions such as envy, regret, or jealousy, often times we don't know how to handle it. Our most common response is just to act out our emotions. 

When we are envious of someone, we just compare our life to them, and we try to be like them. Sometimes, we try to bring them down in order to balance things out. I think feeling our emotions is necessary to be truly human. We cannot just ignore what we feel. When we are sad, I think it has some utility. When you are sad, don't try to be happy but feel the sadness. That sadness will help you to think ideas, and situations you wouldn't think about when you are happy or feeling any other emotions. Your emotions are gateways to some way of thinking. That way of thinking is only available to those certain emotions. The emotion will lead you to some crazy place.

I don't know the specific utility of each emotion, but if you react to each emotion properly then it would not be wasted. Most people just drown their sadness, and their hurts with things like alcohol, games, and just partying with friends. I think drowning your emotions will just add up and become worst in the long run. Eventually, you will have to face it and it will be just a giant monster in front of you waiting to be vanquished. In that state, you won't be able to handle it because it has become too big. It will be a sudden surge of emotion. It is an unhealthy amount which will cause long term effect to your mental health. 

You should deal with your emotions as they come. Don't hide from them.
