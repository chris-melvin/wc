The things happening in our lives might seem random but I think there is meaning or purpose behind it. The actions we do might lead us to become like a tangled thread that is hard to unwind. It might not make sense but the complexity in our lives produces experiences which we won't have if everything is just smooth. The tangled moments are the ones we will remember for our whole life. 

Each thread could be a decision we make, but when there is conflict in our decisions, it might become tangled. The tangled threads causes complexity which in turn pushes us to make difficult decisions. The decisions we make in order to untangle the thread, or lessen the complexity will shape us as human beings. It molds us into the mature person we are supposed to be. 

There is are specific lessons we can learn from complexity or conflict that we cannot learn else where. Be thankful for those moments because the experience and lesson it brings cannot be compared to the normal everyday stuff. 

Each of us will experience difficult moment in our lives. What we do during those moments have a greater impact than what we do during normal times. Cease those moments, and act the best way you know how.
