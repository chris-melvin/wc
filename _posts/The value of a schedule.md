We often times want to live life in our own terms. We want to do whatever we want whenever we want. That is the freedom most people seek. They want to be their own boss. The biggest problem with this idea is that it is hard to find something to do. Living in so much freedom in terms of schedule will lead you to choice paralysis because you have so much to chose from. It is hard to pick an arbitrary activity out of so many things to do. 

Most of the time, people without a schedule will do things out of emotions. When they feel like watching a movie, they will watch a movie. When they feel like eating, they will eat. Everything they do will be fueled by just random urges to do something. Of course, everyone has to follow a schedule for work, or for school, but what I want to emphasize is the value of a schedule during our free time, or personal time.  

If you don't schedule what you want to do during your free time or personal time, then you will do the things that is most fun to you. There is nothing wrong with that per se but in the long run, it will feel like time is passing so fast because you can't remember what you have done. You just focus on entertaining yourself. 

Having a schedule means you get to do things you want to do. Those things that have actual value to you. It could be a hobby, learning new things, reading a book. Whatever it is, you can schedule it, and it will make you feel better not just in the short term. A schedule allows you to do meaningful things in an organized way.
