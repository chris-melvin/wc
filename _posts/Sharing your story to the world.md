You have a story to tell and the world wants to hear it. Even though you think your story might be boring or not worth hearing, there are people willing to listen to your story. Your story could inspire someone to persevere towards their dreams. Your story could bring hope to someone who is hopelesss. Your story could brighten someone's day.

There are a lot of reasons why you should share your story to the world but I think the most important one is because you could impact someones life in unimaginable ways. Even though you think you are just an ordinary citizen, you could have an impact in your sphere of influence. A friend could be inspired by what you do in life and they could seek to become better because of the way you interact with them. 

Sometimes we are afraid to tell our stories because we think people might judge us. You can overcome that fear of judgement by accepting who you are and being true to yourself. If you fear other people's judgement that means you are also judging yourself. 

Share your story to the world in any form. Be it art, literature, music, and even gaming. You just have to be authentic.
