There will be times in your life that you are incessantly doing. You just keep on doing, even though you know you have to stop. There is a reason behind that. Playing a game is fun, but if you play it too much to the point of missing other things, it could be an indication that you are using that game to run away from something. 

When you are travelling to some place you haven't been to and you took the wrong turn, stopping is actually better than continuing to traverse the wrong path. It takes a lot of humility to stop and admit you are wrong when you want to prove that you made the right decision. 

Don't overcommit when you know you made a wrong decision. Know when to stop, accept your mistake, and move on. It is far better than if you continue on the wrong path thinking that you are locked into that path. You can still turn back to the right path. There is still hope.
