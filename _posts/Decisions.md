Life is an amalgam of all the decisions you make and the circumstances you were in. When making big decisions, we think that we need to make the right one or else we will regret it. The problem with that is we won't know if we made the right decision until it is done and the decision has taken effect. We wouldn't also know what will happen on the other side if we made another choice. 

If we are wise, we would have a clue of what would happen when we decide to do something. If it is late at night and we are tired, it is better to rest than to play video games. If we continue to play video games, we won't enjoy it and we will be tired the next day. The wise thing to do is to sleep but more often than not, we will continue playing because we are hooked to the game. 

Making small decisions are more impactful in life than making big ones. I'm not saying one small decisions is more impactful than one big decision but amount of small decision we make everday is what makes our life. Deciding what time we wake up, what we do on our free time, whether or not we learn new things on the weekend. This things are more important than choosing which college we will go to, or which company will we apply in, or whether or not we will resign from work. 

Deciding to better one's life is not one big decision. It is a small decision made every single day. If I decide now I want to have a better life, I have to do it again tomorrow, and the next day.
