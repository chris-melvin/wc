Sometimes you could be tempted to take a day off. When you are too tired from work or school, it could be a good reason for you to not workout or do your daily readings. The issue with taking a break is that it could last longer than you expect. You could plan to take a break for one day but it may become two. The momentum could be lost. Even though you don't feel like doing something, you should still do it. The one thing that allowed me to write every day is pre-decision. You should pre-decide what you should do during the day. 

Making decisions requires a lot of will power. If you think about working out during the afternoon, you should decide on doing in before hand because it actually takes more will power to decide to work out compared to the workout itself. 

When you are tired but you need to do something, decide to do what you need to do, set the time, then take some rest. Most people do it the other way around. They know they have a deadline and they have to finish it, but they take a rest first and wait for the moment they feel like working to get started. Spoiler alert, you won't feel like working until you get pressured by the deadline. When that happens, you would settle for a poor quality work. 

No day off doesn't mean you are not allowed to rest. This just means that if you can still keep on working, do it. Don't miss a day just because you don't feel like doing something. I keep writing even though I don't have ideas. The more I write, the more ideas come. If I wait until I have ideas, then I won't be able to write anything. 

Keep on, and go beyond.
