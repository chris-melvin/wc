Each day we have a choice to become better, stay the same, or let our self rot. If we choose to develop good habits, then we will become better. If we conform to the norms, we will stay the same. If we choose habits that are bad for us, then we will rot. What we do every day has a big impact in our lives because it adds up. Spending 15 minutes a day on something is better than spending an hour each week. The 15 minutes you spend on it will add up exponentially.

The best thing about life is that you are in control of the important things. You choose what you do today. You can choose to improve yourself even though you don't feel doing anything productive. Like most people, I have a hard time keeping my focus. When I try to do something productive, there is this sudden urge to sleep, or play video games. It is a battle in the mind, but you shouldn't fight it. What you can do instead is to change your environment and habits so you will be likely to feel the urge to do something else.

Choosing to improve should have an underlying purpose as to why you are doing it. When you understand that purpose in your heart, you will be able to do hard things. At first, it will be a struggle but as time goes on, you will overcome obstacles easily because you are becoming better.
