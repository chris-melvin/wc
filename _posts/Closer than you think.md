Often times, we stop at the middle because we look at all the effort we have exerted and see no results in sight. You need to continue because you are closer than you think. People are so used to having what they want when they want it that the idea of persevering for something they do not yet see is foreign to them. They want immediate results or at least some visible progress.

Sometimes you can have visible progress in what you do because even though you get  better, it will not be apparent because of a few things. Number one is you do not yet have the appropriate platform to share your craft. Number 2 is the fact that you still haven't reach the threshold that will be considered noteworthy. Number 3 is you are in a stage of growth and showing your skills is unnecessary.

When that happens, you just need to push through. You don't need anything more. You just need to remember where you started, and why you started. Pushing through me exerting extra effort whether or not there is visible progress. 

The wall hindering you to see you destination is not there to stop you, it is there to test you. If you try to find a way other than tearing down those walls, then you might succeed in the short term but eventually bigger walls will be in front of you. You need the skills, and the knowledge you will learn from tearing down the first wall in order to tear the second wall but you just by passed it. You won't be able to bypass the second one, and now you are stuck. You need to learn more and become stronger in order to get past the wall in front of you. Then one after that. 

Overcoming obstacles will help you a lot in your future endeavors.
