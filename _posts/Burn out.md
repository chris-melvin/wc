Maybe we burnout not because we are doing a lot but because we are doing nothing. We just end up thinking of what might happen and start worrying about it rather than thinking of what we want to happen and start working on it. 

The process of thinking is great but if you end up circling back to the idea of something ending up way worse than it use to, then nothing will happen. You will just expend your energy on worrying and ended up being burnt out without actually doing anything. Anxious thoughts burns us out more than actual work. Even though we are not doing anything productive, our mind is working around the clock. We need to put all those thoughts into work. 

In order to avoid burning out, you should do something of value. When you are doing valuable work, you tend to enjoy it more. It is no longer about getting a reward after you are done, the work itself it the reward. You should find things that you enjoy doing that has value to you or to society.
