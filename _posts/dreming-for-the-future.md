Often we dream of the future, we want to have something. Because we don't have it yet, and it is still out of reach, we put it on a pedestal. The distance magnifies the beauty of what we want but not the ugliness. it also magnifies the fact that it looks shiny. the distance increases our desire for that object without even though we haven't put any thought into it. 

We want something thinking we want that something in and of itself but we want the by product of that thing. 

For example, we want to be rich, because it is so far of, we think of the good things wealth brings us, but we don't realize the weight that wealth carries but also that wealth is just a means to what we really want, which is relationships with people and being able to spend time with them. 

The wealth will allow you to do that, but also, you could do that without much wealth. 

So instead of dreaming to be rich, why not be more specific and just desire to have good relationships. I think most people who implicitly knows this are happy and satisfied with what they have. 

They don't want wealth because wealth will not bring them anything more. What they have and what they desire is more valuable than silver or gold. 

Specify what you want and aim at it. Run towards your goal with precision and enthusiasm.
