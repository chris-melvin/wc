There will be times we will wish we were born in a different time, or have been born with a well-off family. But that is not for us to decide. What we will decide is what we do with our time. It can be said that people who are born in wealth will have an easier time. I will not argue against, it is indeed an advantage but each individual has a unique journey. You need not look at the journey of others, though it might be helpful, but focus on your journey first. Envy might overcome you before you learn from their journey.

People during war time will want peace, people during peace time will want some excitement. Understanding the circumstance you are in and doing the necessary thing to be done is the best mode of being. You cannot just act in a deviant manner and expect everyone to understand you. It is important to know the times, and how to respond to the times. We only have one life to live. We ought to live it our fully.

Whatever you chose to do with your time, make sure to live it. Don't just go and mindlessly live your life. Live it out, and live it out to the full. Don't just fall into your urges. Be intentional in the way you live.
