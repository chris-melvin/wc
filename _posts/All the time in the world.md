We have all the time in the world to do meaningful things that could give us joy. We have 24 hours in a day. A rich person's 24 hours is different from someone with so much responsibility. A rich person can outsource household chores while  someone who doesn't have enough money will need to do it themselves. Even though some people don't have as much free time as those who can afford to outsource their responsibilities, I can still argue that everyone still has the opportunity to do meaningful things.

Usually, the problem is not time but the will to do something. People will say they have the will, but they just don't have the time. The will to do something will create time. It a person has enough will to do something, they can put it in their schedule and do it. Doing something as little as practicing for 15 mins a day, or running for 30 mins, or studying for a hour if done consistently can bring us closer to our goal.

I admit I have a lot of time, and I wasted most of it. I wanted to learn so much things, and I wanted to produce so much content but I never get to do any of it. The problem for me is not time, the problem for me is the will to do it. I want the idea of having the final product but I haven't got in my system the joy of actually doing it. Right now, the only thing I got going is writing. I've been writing everyday for the past month and I have to say it is enjoyable. 

I could do more with what I write. I can publish it so more people can read it, but that means more work. I want to prepare myself for more. I have all the time in the world. I can do so much. I want to start to create again.
