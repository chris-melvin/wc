Sometimes we think we already know enough that is why we don't push ourselves to learn everyday. There is so much to learn in this world. We want the illusion of knowledge rather than the knowledge itself. We want to be seen as smart rather than being smart because being seen as smart is easy but being smart requires hard work.

We should never stop learning. We should learn not because we want to look smart but because we want to be smart. We should pursue knowledge in the purest sense. Learning should be enjoyable. There a beautiful quote by socrates that goes "I know that I know nothing." Being aware that what you know is no where near what you ought to know allows us to be humble and learn things that would be passed by if we think we already know it.

Everyday is an opportunity to learn. If we consistently learn something everyday, then we would be better off than if we just go by our day and learn nothing. 

Never stop learning. Don't just gain knowledge, but also gain understanding.
