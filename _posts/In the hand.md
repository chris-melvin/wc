As people, we want to accumulate a lof of stuff. We want to have material things because having them could make our life better. We think that if we have a bigger house, a faster car, and a shinier watch then we would be happier. Material things have their purpose so I don't count them as useless but it shoudn't be everything. We all understand that we shouldn't be materialistic but we still need material things. What we have in our hands has value to us. The things we own represents something.

Owning the latest iphone is good but do we really need to uprade even though what we currently have works well? Wanting more is good, but when will more be enough? When can we say that what we have in our hands can satisfy our longing?

G.K. Chesterton said "There are two ways to have enough, to accumulate more and more, or to desire less." We can't really have enough, because when we have more, we will want more. So the only way is to desire less. We should understand that the things in our hand, the things we own is part of our lives. We need to learn to work with what we have. We can add more, but desiring for something we don't need instead of using what we have is just a way to find that spike in dopamine. Being content with what's in your hand could lead to more happiness. 

If happiness depends on things you don't have rather than the things you have, then you will be misrable. Be thankful for what you have. Your happiness should depend on what's in the heart rather than what's in the hand.
