A lot of people want to become successful but not everyone is willing to put in the work. There is a little secret that is not so secret to success. You just need to show you and you are already half way done. In everything you do, most people overthink their preparation. When its the first day of school, and you are anxious of what's gonna happen, that is normal. You don't know anyone, and you don't know what you are going to do. That is all normal. If you just show up, you will realize, you are not the only one who is anxious. You will realize that every else feels the same way. Once you get the hang of it, then you have to finish the other half. 

Sometimes you don't have to prepare for things. You just need to show up, and things will happen. When you are applying for a job, you'll be anxious of everything that is going to happen. But you are thinking ahead of yourself. You should just think about the next step. Don't worry about what's gonna happen next. Just focus on showing up, and giving your all. Prepare for what's in front of you. Don't waste mental energy for something you cannot control. If you don't get accepted, then accept what happened and move on, and when you do get accepted, then prepare for what happens next.

There will be differet moments in our lives that we are afraid to show up to. We might run away from it for a while until we finally muster up the courage to go and confront it. We will then realize that we have wasted so much time. Instead of running away, we should have faced it in the first place. Show up to the place you are running away from. Don't waste anymore time.
