When playing chess, you think about not only the next move, but the next few moves. It depends on how good you are at playing chess. Most beginners will only look for the next move, but the grandmasters can see up to 10 moves in advance. A grandmaster is always prepared for what is going to happen. They know and understand different lines in a chess position. Even if the opponent move one piece instead of another, they still know their next moves even before it happens. 

It our life, we can apply the techniques from chess. We should think about the next moves even before the circumstance is presented to us. We should know what to know if we succeed or fail. I think real failure is being stuck when you don't know what to do and you are just paralized where you are. Your next moves are important because it will determine where you will end up in. Each move is important, but a series of moves, if done well is the secret to success. You should plan single moves because circumstances will change after that move. 

Whatever you do in your life, you should plan ahead. Even though there is not perfect plan, it is better to go on a journey with a plan and make adjustments along the way than to have no plan at all.
