# Some days are a little tough

Some days are a little tough. I've experienced days when I'm totally not functioning. Even though I have a lot of things to do, I'm just stuck. I can't even look the my school works because just thinking about them gives me anxiety. I just wallow in fear and , and think eventually I will feel like starting. 

I've realized just recently that immersing myself in entertainment won't ignite a spark in me to start doing. The thing that ignited me was a conversation with a friend. There is nothing particularly motivating about what we talked about. The people I was talking to didn't even try to motivate me. Having the conversation itself ignited the fire to make me want continue. It was the gesture of having a conversation that gave me the drive to keep on

## Don't be afraid to talk to someone. 
When I experienced sad moments in my life, I often want to talk to people. I will take me a while to build up the courage to ask someone to a conversation because I'm afraid to get rejected. But when I'm finally conversing with someone, I say to myself "Why didn't I do this earlier". Instead of waiting to build up the courage to talk to someone, just go. If you get rejected and they say they are busy, don't take it personally because we all have battles we have to face, but when you found the person who is willing to talk to you, you will eventually feel a little bit better.

## A simple "How are you?" can make a difference
Asking a friend how are you in the moments they wallowing in sadness could mean a lot. It's a simple question but the gesture can brighten up their day. When you feel like your friend is struggling with something, don't hesitate asking how they are doing. That simple gesture can make their day better, and even yours. 

When two dim lights come together, it can make the work a little brighter.
