I learned the concept of self rules a long time ago but I heard it again when I watched Naruto. Might Guy, one of the characters taught his student about making self rules. A self rule is when you set something up for yourself to do or not to do. It is a promise that you yourself is the only one accountable. Creating a self rule is a good way to increase discipline because it trains you to push through even though something is hard to do. 

I've set a self rule before, I didn't allow myself to use my phone when it is bed time. The reasoning for that is when our eyes see light during the night, it messes up our circadian rythm. It is harder to fall a sleep when I use my phone, especially when I am watching youtube videos. Of course it is a hard rule to follow because more often than not, I use youtube videos to help me fall asleep but it doesn't actually help me.

Establishing self rules should not be tyrannical in which you are not allowed to do so much things. Self rules should help you, not restrict you from doing things. There are things you do that are not helpful and better if you don't do it. If you are able to properly set rules that are benefical, then you can grow faster. 

In creating self rules, you need to identify the things that you always do and is not beneficial but is hard to let go. If you find yourself scrolling through social media during work hours, then you should make a self rule that you are not allowed to open social apps during work hours. It may seem harsh, but it is for the better. Your rules should serve a purpose. You shouldn't restrict yourself from doing something for the sake of abstinence. The goal is to have self control. The better self rules you set, the better self control you will have.
