title: 'The value of life'
excerpt: The value of life doesn't depend on how long it last, or how many people you had an impact on. I think the value of life depends on each moment you spent here on earth. You cannot measure the total value of one's life but I think that the moments we spend here on earth holds the value.

The value of life doesn't depend on how long it last, or how many people you had an impact on. I think the value of life depends on each moment you spent here on earth. You cannot measure the total value of one's life but I think that the moments we spend here on earth holds the value. Those individual moments we spent with our family, and friends are the ones we could cherish forever. 

Those **moments** hold the value of life. 

Those moments are a slice in time that we could call our own. It doesn't need to be remembered. It only needs to be *experienced*. 

I hope, to who ever is reading this, that you will cherish every moment, even while you are in them. While spending time with your friends, don't forget to pause for a while, and be grateful that you are able to spend it with them.
