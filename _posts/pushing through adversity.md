There are times in our lives that everything is going smoothly. Good thing are happening, and we feel the momentum of our productivity. This are the times we get things done. But somewhere along the way, adversity will come. It is hard to continue because often times, the things that are hindering us in what we are doing is new to us. It is hard to push through something we haven't experienced yet. Suddenly, fear will creep into us. We will now start to doubt our ability to finish what we are doing. When this happens, we are now distracted from our goal.

Pushing through adversity is one of the most useful skill we can have. There will be a lot of things that will give us a hard time in pursuing what we do. Being able to push through even though we are in an uncharted teritories is a great advantage because this is where a lot of people give up. People who give up when faced with adversity often think that bad things only happens to them, and good things only happens to the people who already succeeded. They never realized that the people who succeeded did not only experienced bad things, but they got a lot of it. They experienced hardships and adversities before they can get their break. 

The successful among us are the ones who are willing to go through adversity and make something for themselves without wavering. They will push through even though they don't see results.
