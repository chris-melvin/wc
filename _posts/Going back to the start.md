If you are stuck, you need not learn something new. What you need is to go back to the start. Go back to the reason why you do what you do. 

You need to go back where it all began, when it was real, when it was untainted by the mess of this world. Go back to the purest desires of your heart. 

When we get stuck, we often think of learning something new. We look forward to that one change that will boost our growth so we can overcome our obstacles. I'm not opposed to learning new things, but I think there are moments when we just need to go back to where we started. Go back to the moment before you took that leap of faith, the moment when you were still joyful, and full of life, the moment where the dream began. 

Where you began is the moment a spark created a flame in your heart. What ever it may be, it is something that keeps you moving. But because of the storms of this world, the fire in your heart becomes a little dimmer. You wanted to protect it because you want it to keep burning but you end it locking it inside a vault in your heart, where no one can see it, even you. You need to go back to the start, and rekindle the flame within. You don't need to be on fire, burning at a maximum every moment of every day. You just need to keep the flame growing, even by just a little. 

Don't let the storms of this world quench the fire burning inside of you. 

You may have deviated from the path you're suppose to take, but you can still go back. No matter how far you have traveled, you can still go back. As long as you carry the fire, it will guide you where you are suppose to go. So don't falter, and don't lose hope because you can always go back to the start to remind you of who you really are.
