There is a lot of suffering in this world. The question I often ask myself is "How can I reduce the suffering in this world?" "How can I help other people who are suffering greatly?" I have the intention to make some change but can I really make a difference? Can what I do have an impact in other peoples lives? 

Intent is nothing without action, but what can I do? I've realize that I don't have to help everybody, I just have to be intentional in what I do. Helping everybody is impossible because obviously, I don't have the resources to help all those in need. Helping one person can make so much difference, but it depends on what kind of help. Intentional helping means we do things not for the sake of doing something, but for seeing out what we do until the end. Being intentional is not just a one time thing, it is something we commit to. 

Our intentional actions can make this world a better place. Even though we cannot eliminate suffering, we can lessen it. Our little action can send a   ripple effect that will affect a lot of people. 

Be intentional.
