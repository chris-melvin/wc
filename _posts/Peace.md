Peace is hard to come by when everything around you is falling apart. But peace is not what's around you, it is in your heart. I have heard of an good analogy about peace. Having peace is like sailing on a boat in the middle of a roaring ocean, even though the waves are high, and the situation seems dire, you still have hope that everything will be alright because you know the boat can handle of all that. 

You will experience peace if your heart is a peace. Even though the world around you has so much chaos, as long as you have true peace in your heart, then you can hold firm into it and conquer all the trouble around you. 

Sometimes it feels like the whole world is crashing down and no good thing is happening in my life, I first try to solve external problems because I think it will solve internal ones. But I have realized that my external problems are manifestations of the chaos in my heart. By dealing with chaos in my heart, then I could approach the chaos around me with stillness. Finding the missing peace doesn't mean all the chaos will disappear and everything will be instantly okay. It just means that you can be still in the midst of everything happening and you can go on, headstrong and face your battles knowing everything will work together for good.
