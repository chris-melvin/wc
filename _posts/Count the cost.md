The true measure of power of a strong attack is its efficiency. When something is strong but cost so much, it counldn't be considered powerful. But if something it strong and cost little, then its power is 

When you count the cost of what you are doing, then you will know how much you will commit to something. You don't need to hesitate on your decision because you know what is going to happen. You have committed to something that is good for you and you know the sacrifice you have taken. You already know what is going to be lost. You don't need to worry about thinking of what you will lose. 

Counting the cost also means you are ready for what's about to happen and if you don't lose what you expected to lose, then it is good for you. Most people don't count the cost because they think they won't lose. They just go for something then not do anything about it. I can say as much as I want to enjoy the things I have, I still think about what is costing me. I don't know the cost yet because I'm not counting the cost. Spending time for something when you could be doing something else is a sacrifice. And if you are not doing what needs to be done, then you are sacrificing your future for the present. Most people who just enjoys the current time sacrifices their future. The successful among us delay gratification. That means they sacrifice present pleasure for future success, which will in turn produce more pleasure. 

Once I can do that, then I will be successful.


To know oneself is not to achieve everything and become perfect. It's knowing what you can and cannot do.
