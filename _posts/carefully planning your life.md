There are a lot of things we can do in this life. We could be tempted to just approach life as if opportunities will come to us. Tomorrow offers a lot of things but you have to work for it. Just because there is an abundance in opportunities doesn't mean they will come to you.

You need to carefully plan your life. Don't just wake up in the morning not knowing what to do because you will just chase the thing that gives you the most pleasure. You won't try to become better if you don't have a plan because you are not aiming for something, you are just aiming for pleasure. The problem with aiming with pleasure is you can just get it in today's day and age. The phone in the palm of your hands has access to a lot of entertaining videos that could make you laugh, cry, and feel the sense of belongingness. 

The first step of planning your life is having a place to go. I doesn't need to be specific, it just have to something bigger than yourself. You should settle for what's easy. Aim for something achievable yet will make you grow. 

The second thing you need to do is establish the way you want to approach it. You have to change your lifestyle if you want to reach your goal. You can't take everything with you. There are habits that needs to go. Learn to live with the sacrifices you make.

The final thing I can say is just enjoy the process. This is simple but important. Enjoying the process means you are in the right track. Yes, there will be sacrifices and hard decisions along the way but you will be ready for that and you know that it will be worth it.

Making a plan doesn't mean that everything will go according to what you have planned but it will serve as a guide for you. It is better to have a plan than to move forward aimlessly into the world. You will more likely be lost when you don't have anywhere to go.
