People have a hard time committing to a daily routine because they will eventually give up along the way, and they don't want that feeling of failure. A daily don't have to last a lifetime, you just have to do it long enough for it to become a habit. Then it will be effortless when you do it. 

When starting a routine, there will be a lot of friction to begin with. It is hard to find time to be productive when there are so many alternatives that is both fun, and easy to do. For example, you want to write everyday. The first question is what time will you write? It is in the morning, before school or work, or is it in the evening, when all the daily things you do is done? You need to settle which time you will do it, and you need to stick to it. There are different pros and cons on writing during different times. You need to weigh it based on your needs. 

The one thing I have learned when it comes to having a daily routine is it's possible. It is possible to consistently do something productive everyday. Before I built a daily writing habit, I was only fueld by motivation. I only writing when I'm motivated and inspired. When there is not motivation or inspiration, I don't do anything. The problem with that is motivation and inspiration doesn't come when you are not doing anything. The more you do, the more motivated and inspired you become. Even though I'm not motivated to write, I still write. I just write about random topics that comes to my head. It doesn't matter if it makes sense, what matters is I see the idea through the end. 

Having a daily routine will help you grow in whatever craft you are in. Small incremental improvements will add up overtime, and eventually you will realize how much you have grown overtime.
