I have always thought that self-care is natural for everyone. I thought doing the daily routine such as eating, taking a bath, and sleeping is enough self-care. I didn't realize that you actually need to be intentional in self-care until I have found myself not caring about my own well-being. 

I care for myself, I'm even selfish in some moments when I want to eat more food. But I have realized that there are moments when I neglect myself. I tend to eat late in the morning, and I tend to sleep late at night. I don't eat much healhy food, and there are times I don't eat at all.

Self-care must be intentional. You need to take care of yourself the same way you take care of someone you love. Want the best for yourself. Watch yourself when you are doing things that punishes you. You might do things unknowingly to make your life a little harder. 

There are a lot of practical ways for us to take better care of ourself but the best way I think is to create an ideal day, and intentionally live out that day. Of course, you won't be able to reach the ideal consistently but if you are aiming for something, then at least there is something to guide you. 

Self-care is good, and we have to make a concious effort in doing it.
