Sometimes, things happens that we don't know the reason for. People do stuff that we think are unnecessary. If they just stayed away from a fight they don't need to take, then it will be possible that could have survived. Only they could understand why do did it. Other people will just make theories on why they did it, then stick with their own conclusions. 

With that said, we must know our motives when we do something. We must not just go with the flow. If we do go with the flow, we must understand why. Knowing why you do something, no matter how you do it means you have a stronger commitment. No know why you do something makes you vulnerable to being dissuaded. You could just let go of everything you hold on to. If someone you are talking to really convinced you of something. 

Once you understand why you do what you do, then it will be easier to exercise your desires. You don't have much internal conflict, and most of the time, you will know what to do during difficult situations. Commit to what you understand is right but make changes when new things come up. Consider them carefully but don't settle too much on what you already have. Make room for flexibility while maintaining foundation on your beliefs.
