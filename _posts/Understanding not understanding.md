When i was a child, I didn't understand how the world works. I was curious, so naturally, I asked a lot of questions. Most of those questions are not to other people but to myself. I wanted to understand something, so I investigated further and I followed my curiousity. My curiosity helped my understand the world better. I gained knowledge I wouldn't otherwise gained if I hadn't had been so ccurious. 

But as I grew older, I realized I'm asking fewer and fewer questions. I'm no longer as curious as before. I thought to myself that it is a product of me knowing a lot of things that is why I no longer question things as often because I understand them better. That could be the case or maybe I just lost my curiousity because I'm drowning in so much information that I'm not able to process it. 

I think we are in a time that we think we know so much because all of the information in the world is just a few clicks away. We could just type up a search query, and we will know the pythagorean theorem, know what a tensor is, or know the capital of Spain. We can know a lot things, but we don't really understand them. We are in a time that we don't care about gaining new information because everybody else has access to the same information. The very thing that could help us gain more knowledge is the one keeping us from actually acquiring more. We are no longer eager to understand something because knowledge has become this throw away thing that everyone can have.

We have a lot of information but little understanding. We should seek deeper understanding of what we know because it helps us understand the world better. We should never stop asking questions, even the dumbest ones because it could lead to asking more questions that could lead to new knowledge. So keep seeking, and stay curious.
