There will be opportunities in our lives that will come once in a while. Those opportunities requires us to take a leap. It is not a far leap in which will have drastic life changing effects but it is a decision that needs a lot of courage. When we are at our comfort zones, everything is easy to do. I also think that being of your comfort zone is easier than going out of your comfort zone. 

Being out is a state while going out is an action. Once you took the leap, it will feel scary at first but eventually the things will become normal and it will become part of your comfort zone. But the decision that got you there is a hard decision. The action necessary to go out cost more energy. 

When making a decision such as migrating to another country, the friction is when you make the decision to hop on a plane and go to another country. Once you have arrived, then you will naturally adapt to the culture and the environment. It will not be instantaneous but because you havecrossed over and made the decision to take the leap everything will be easier. 

Hard decisions requires you to take a stand. Whether you choose to take the leap or not, stand by it. Don't ever think about what would happen if you did it or not because it will slow you down. Just commit to where you are and focus on where you are going.
