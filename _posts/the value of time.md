People often think that their greatest asset is their money. No matter how much you have, it will never be as valuable as your time. Yes, people exchange their time to earn more money but they reason people want more money is because they want to have a better lifestyle. 

Everyone has the same amount of time each day. Each person spends their time uniquely. Each one does their own thing. They do whatever they want with it. The best use of our time here on earth is to do something meaningful. Each day, you have an opportunity to do something meaningful. 

We can spend each day trying to entertain ourself, and exhaust ourself with meaningless things. Of course, those things have a purpose of their own, but in the bigger picture, there are activtiies in our lives that just doesn't help.

The best thing we could do is find the thing that gives our life meaning. That way, we are not wandering around trying to do random things because nothing satisfies our longings. Living a meaningful life means making the most out of our time. We need to maximize our time by spending it doing the things that makes us better and propels us forward.

You cannot get time back once you have spent it. Don't waste it on things you don't value.
