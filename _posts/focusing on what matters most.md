The mess in our lives pile up because we think having a lot of things can satisfy us. But no matter how useful those things are for a season, it will eventually become a mountain of mess we don't need.

The mountain of mess will cloud our thinking. We no longer see what matters most. We just see what is immediately ahead. We see the bills we have to pay, the reports we have to finish, and the responsibility we have to fulfill. We are no longer purpose-driven, but fear-driven. We fear failing expectations because when we do, we will drown a sea of uncertainty.

We declutter to be able to see what matters most. For different people, what matters most could mean different things. It could be providing for your family, achieving your dreams, or helping other people. All of this is good, but for the Christian it is different. Before we ask "what matters most?", we ask, "who matters most?" The answer is Jesus. Jesus is who matters most. Once we have understood that, we will understand what matters most in this life, and that is to live life for Him and with Him.

I cannot explain it through my words, but once you have experienced a life with Jesus, you will understand what it means to live life to what matters most.
