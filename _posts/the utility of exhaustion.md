A lot of people don't like the feeling of being tired. When you are tired and drain, you don't function properly. The best thing to do is rest. Rest is enjoyable because it rejuvinates the body. If we never get exhausted then we will just continue on working and doing. The problem with that is we could do things that are bad for us. 

Taking a break allows us to be aligned with what we need to do. We could be overworking ourself for something we don't want. We just work towards something because that is what's in front of us. Sometimes the best thing to do is to do nothing. Doing something could make things worse. Being tired and exhausted is a way of our body to tell us to take a break. No only because our body needs it, but our mind also. 

It is okay to take a break. Don't push yourself too hard. Even though you are seeing people grinding all day long doesn't mean you have to outclass then. Work on your own pace. Take breaks, and enjoy your rest.
