I used to think that the value of friendship is for it to last long. In its essence friendship was a constant improvement of relationship. The more you get closer, the better the friendship is. But I just realize the desire to get closer to a friend is not a healthy one. It just leads to an obsession or it is an early signs of obsession. You wanting to be close to a person is a normal thing but if closes is all you seek, then it is unhealthy. You should consider that closeness it itself is not the essence of friendship but just a by product of it.

Your friends sharing deep intimate stuff with you is just a by-product of your friendship. It is not something you should seek in itself. You should not obsess over one person. You should not desire to be their favorite friend. They are just people who share common interest and you get to live life with them. They are not your possession and they are not your collection.

I think the real essence of friendship is you witnessing their walk in this life. You are witnessing each other's lives and both of you are living in that moment. That is your slice of time in this overwhelming world. No one can take that away from you. Your friendship is not valuable because it lasted, it is valuable because it is real. It doesn't need to last as long as you know you are being authentic, then it is good.

I think that friendships are one of the most beautiful thing to happen. You can meet new people and they can help you in their walk and you can help them in theirs. it is just a a wonderful experience. 

More people should realize how much valuable it is to have a good friend.
