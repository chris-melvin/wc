When you lose something, you gain something more valuable, time and space to do another thing. Some people might think this is just a way to convince myself that It's okay to lose something but I really think that sometimes losing something is a good thing.

There are habits or things we do that is not beneficial to us. If lose that habit, we can replace it with something better. When your hands are full, you can't grasp the new things coming to you. You need empty hands in order to grab new things. That is why you need to let go of thing that is just hurting you the longer you hold on to it. 

I can think of many things in my life that I still hold on to even though it hurts me just because I became accustomed to it. It is hard and it takes time to let go but eventually it will be worth it.
