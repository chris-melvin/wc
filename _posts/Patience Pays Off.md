title: 'Patience Pays Off'
excerpt: Patience is one of the most underated virtues. You can't see its effects immediately, but you can see the effect of its inverse in a instant. When someone is patient in what they are doing, the fruits won't immediately show because obviously, it takes time.

Patience is one of the most underated virtues. You can't see its effects immediately, but you can see the effect of its inverse in a instant. When someone is patient in what they are doing, the fruits won't immediately show because obviously, it takes time. When someone is impatient, you can immediately see the mistake they did. 

But being impatient isn't necessarily bad. I read this quote that said "Be patient in results, be impatient in action." This is a wonderful quote because it captures the essence of why we should be patient. We should continue of doing what we are doing, but we shouldn't rush the results. We shouldn't wait for the perfect opportunity to start because the best time to start was yesterday, and the second best time is today. 

Even if what you are doing is not yealding immediate results, just keep going. Athletes don't become becaues of one workout, they become strong because they know the power doing one thing repeatedly over a long period of time. You won't see the fruits on the first day, but eventually you will reap its reward.
