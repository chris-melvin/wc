Why is a sunset beautiful? is it because it is unique or it is because its temporary?

I may be wrong in this but I think there is this kind of beauty we cannot explain. Staring at the clouds during sunset is a wonderful experience. It is something worth sharing with your friends. Sunsets happen everyday, but its not repeated. Everyday has a unique sunset. Just because your day is the same unproductive day, just like yesterday doesn't mean you should end it the same.

There is still time to shine your light upon the clouds and make a beautiful array of colors vibrantly displaying its beauty into the world.

We can look at sunrise as an ending but we can also look at it as a beginning of a beautiful night that will lead to a lot of wonderful adventures.
