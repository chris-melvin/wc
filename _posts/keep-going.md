Keep going, even when you don't want to. It is impossible to reach your goal when you are not moving forward. There will be times when you are not motivated to do what you do, but you should still keep going. Even if you are not seeing results, you need to grind it out because when the dust settles, you will thank yourself for not giving up. 

When you are doing some push ups, and you feel like you are done, do one more rep. If you are writing and you think you have no more ideas, write one more paragraph. If you are studying and you want to watch movies, study for one more hour. By giving it your all, and then some, you will reach you goal faster than if you just do what's enough. 

When running a marathon, the athletes don't make a full stop once they have reached the finish line. Once they have reached the finish line, only then they start to slow down until they eventually stop. They don't slow down before reaching finish line, I think they actually run faster. 

In the work you are doing, don't slow down when you are getting close to your goal, only slow down once your are done. This will make your more effecient and produce better output. 

Keep going
